1. Strings are IMMUTABLE (It cannot be broken down further).
2. Strings are stored in two ways in JVM.
    - String Constant pool (String s="Balu")
    - Heap Area             (String s1=new String("Balu"))

3. Strings are created in 5 different ways
    - String s="Balu";
    - String s1=new String("Balu");
    - StringBuffer
    - StringBuilder
    - toCharArray()

  4. StringBuilder & StringBuffer are the two classes which should be used when we perform
      string manipulation and other operations for group of words.

      StringBuilder is NOT THREAD SAFE.
      StringBuffer is THREAD SAFE.

      StringBuilder is used and is faster in SINGLE THREADED environment.
      StringBuffer is used and is faster in MULTI THREADED environment.
