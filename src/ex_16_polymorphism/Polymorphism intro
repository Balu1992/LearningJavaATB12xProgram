Polymorphism means the ability of an object to act in multiple forms based on the varied situations.

Ex: Steering is the common object which is present for all four wheelers and it varies from size in different vehicles

There are 2 types of polymorphism: Compile time, Run time polymorphism

Compile time :
    - Its known as method overloading.
    - Multiple methods with same name and can have different parameters in class.

 Run time:
    - Its known as method overriding.
    - Multiple methods with different name can be available but same parameters should be used in class
