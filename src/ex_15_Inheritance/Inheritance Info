INHERITANCE is the process of grabbing methods and behaviors from PARENT/SUPERCLASS to CHILD/SUB class

We have totally 5 types of inheritance.
- Single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, hybrid

Single inheritance is the most widely used inheritance in automation.

Hybrid & Multiple inheritance is not supported by java. It can achieved through INTERFACES.
